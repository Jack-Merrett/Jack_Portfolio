# Completed Projects
## [Anime recommender](https://ani-reco.streamlit.app/)
- 3 Person Team, I was in charge of making a machine learning model given a data set that was cleaned by our team's data analyst.
- The timeline was two weeks. We were able to make two different models: a user-data based model and a nonuser-data based model.
- Python(SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, SciKit-Surprise), Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit.

# Current Projects
## [Tokyo Resturant Recommender](https://github.com/Wolfinbarger/OniGiri)
- our three man team is currently trying to build a resturant recommoneder for the tokyo metropolitan area.
- It is a mixture of front end and back end, but I found, cleaned, and exported the correct data to the specified file type (json).
- Jupyter Notebook, Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, numpy.)
