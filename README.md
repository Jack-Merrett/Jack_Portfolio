## [Electrocardiogram Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/Jack-Merrett/data-electrocardiograms) (Data Science)
- This project is to show my prowess with logistic modeling for classification.
- Using a dataset we will explore, train, and use a model to predic if a patient is "at-risk" of cardiac problems.
- Python, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook.

## [Anime recommender](https://ani-reco.streamlit.app/) (Data Science)
- 3 Person Team, I was in charge of making a machine learning model given a data set that was cleaned by our team's data analyst.
- The timeline was two weeks. We were able to make two different models: a user-data based model and a nonuser-data based model.
- Python(SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, SciKit-Surprise), Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit.

# Current Ongoing Projects
## [Tokyo Resturant Recommender](https://github.com/Wolfinbarger/OniGiri) (Data Science/ Analysis)
- our four man team is currently trying to build a resturant recommoneder for the tokyo metropolitan area.
- It is a mixture of front end and back end, but I found, cleaned, and exported the correct data to the specified file type (json).
- Jupyter Notebook, Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy.)
