## [Electrocardiogram Predictive Modeling](https://github.com/Jack-Merrett/data-electrocardiograms) (Data Science)
- This project is to show my prowess with logistic modeling for classification.
- Using a dataset we will explore, train, and use a model to predic if a patient is "at-risk" of cardiac problems.
- Python, SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook.

## [Anime recommender](https://ani-reco.streamlit.app/) (Data Science)
- 3 Person Team, I was in charge of making a machine learning model given a data set that was cleaned by our team's data analyst.
- The timeline was two weeks. We were able to make two different models: a user-data based model and a nonuser-data based model.
- Python(SciKit-Learn, Numpy, Pandas, SciKit-Surprise), Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit.

# Current Ongoing Projects
## [Tokyo Resturant Recommender](https://github.com/Wolfinbarger/OniGiri) (Data Science/ Analysis)
- Image you're in Tokyo and you're hungry, but you don't know what to eat. You pull out your phone and are bombarded with more options then youÂ  know what to do with. Oni-giri will select either at random or with some bias (your user info) to give you a selection of restaurants in your ward until you find something you like.
- Our four man team is currently trying to build a restaurant recommender for the Tokyo metropolitan area.
- It is a mixture of front end and back end, but I found, cleaned, and exported the correct data to the specified file type (json).
- Jupyter Notebook, Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy.)

## [Space Titanic Analysis and Predictons](https://github.com/Jack-Merrett/space-titanic-project) (Data Science/ Analysis)
- Using a data set I found on Kaggle Call [Space Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).
- Used data explorations, cleaning, feature engineering, to get valuable insites and make predictions on the data.
- Jupyter Notebook, Python(Pandas, Matplotlib, numpy, seaborn), Machine Learning.
